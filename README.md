# Welcome DragonCon project

## About DragonCon
[DragonCon](http://dragoncon.co.il) is an Israeli convention for tabletop gaming.<br>
We have Roleplaying games, Live action games, board games and so much more

## About the system

At some point, we needed a better system to keep the convention up and running, the original code was built to handle 1-day convention for a few hours. After patching it up quite a bit, it was time to rewrite the code.<br>
<br>
So, why not make the code available to other small convention? <br>
Yeah, it'll be partially in Hebrew, be should be easily replaced in the View section of the project.
<br>
We want to offer the participants a User-Managed screen, where they can register to the site, select events and buy tickets.
We also want to support staff's backstage work, with different permissions.
<br>

## Who are we ?
We are **Eliran Teller** (github/TheMadKow) and **Adi Unger**, working together in pair programming style.<br>

## Version

At this point in time, we don't have anything functional. As we make progress, we will update this section.
