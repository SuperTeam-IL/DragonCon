## Welcome DragonCon project

### About DragonCon
[DragonCon](http://dragoncon.co.il) is an Israeli convention for gaming.<br>
We have Roleplaying games, Live action games, board games and so much more

### About the system

At some point, we needed a better system to keep this convention working.<br>
We want to offer user management, event registrations, ticket pairing and simpler UX both to participants and content managers.<br>
This code is under GPL-2.0 liecnce, so feel free to poke around while we build the code.

### Version

At this point in time, we don't have anything functional. As we make progress, we will update this section.
